# GET Protocol state change counter - DEPRECIATED
Integrators of the GET Protocol(ticketing companies) are required to use GET as fuel in order to use the features. This tool allows the community to track the usage of GET by statechange usage in the past. 

This script this repo queries the GET Protocol anchoring contract between provided blockheights. All the IPFS batches found will be extracted/downloaded and stored to a pandas dataframe. After the last batch in the blockheight range has been extracted from IPFS the dataframes will be stored in a .csv file. 

**Note: Before the GET Protocol moved to ERC721 tickets we used 'ticket proofs' pinned on IPFS, with the IPFS pointer published on the Ethereum blockchain. This method of smart ticket registration spanned 2018-2020. It has long since been depreciated. This repo contains the code that was used to verify the published state (like a ZK-proof). Due to its 'age' it likely will not run anymore. We keep it online as to document/showcase our journey.** 

### !! Be aware that script can have a long run-time !!
Depending on the start and stop height that is defined, it might take a while before the script terminates. This is because all IPFS batches are pulled from the ETH anchor contract one by one. 

Take note that this long duration isn't due to Ethereum to be slow or because the script is overly complex. The process that requires the most time is downloading/pulling of the mutation files from IPFS. Similar to how it can take a while before a bitcoin node is fully synced up.


###### Example values: 2020 Q2 blockheights:
_startheight=9743576
_stopheight=10338066

Use the ethereum blockchain explorer like blockchair to figure out what blockheight constitutes to a certain moment in time: https://blockchair.com/ethereum/blocks?s=time(desc)&q=time(2020-03-31)#

#### Requirements / Installation
- Set up an account with etherscan.com and obtain API key -> config.py
- Set up a free account with infura and optain API key -> config.py

WIHTOUT API KEYS THIS SCRIPT WILL NOT RUN!

#### Usage (VirtualEnv)
Make sure you have installed venv (pip install virtualenv). Then while in the root folder of this repo:
``` 
$ virtualenv venv
```
Activate the venv
``` 
$ source venv/bin/activate
```
To properly manage all required package we use pipenv which should be installed:
```
$ pip install pipenv
``` 
Now pipenv is installed, it can be used to install all requirements:
``` 
$ pipenv install
```
Done. You are ready to use the counter!

After having set up the requirments it is possible to run a count of the state changes registered between the provided blockheight as such: 
``` 
$ python import_IPFS.py --startheight <INTEGER> --stopheight <INTEGER> 
```
Depending on the provided blockheights, this can take between a few minutes to an hour (or more).

###### Example queries venv
Short execution time(10k blocks -> 36-100 seconds)
```
$ python import_IPFS.py --startheight=10328066 --stopheight=10338066
```

Medium execution time(300k blocks -> 18 minutes) 
```
$ python import_IPFS.py --startheight=10038066 --stopheight=10338066 
```

Long execution time(600k blocks -> 20-40 minutes): 
```
$ python import_IPFS.py --startheight=9743576 --stopheight=10338066
```

#### Usage (Docker)

```
$ docker build -t counter .
$ docker run counter --startheight <INTEGER> --stopheight <INTEGER>
```

We then extract the csv results from the container. For that, first we find the container ID and then we copy as:
```
$ docker ps -alq
$ docker cp <PREVIOUS_COMMAND_RESULT>:/code/count_results .
```

###### Example queries Docker
Short execution time(10k blocks -> 36-100 seconds)
```
$ docker build -t counter .
$ docker run counter --startheight 10328066 --stopheight 10338066
```

### Exploring the results
You'll find the results under the folder `./count_results` on your local directory
